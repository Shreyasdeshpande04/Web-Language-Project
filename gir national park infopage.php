<strong><p style="font-size:25px">Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, also known as Sasan Gir, is a forest, national park, and wildlife sanctuary near Talala Gir in Gujarat, India. It is located 43 km (27 mi) north-east of Somnath, 65 km (40 mi) south-east of Junagadh and 60 km (37 mi) south-west of Amreli. It was established in 1965 in Nawab of Junagarh private hunting area, with a total area of 1,412 km2 (545 sq mi), of which 258 km2 (100 sq mi) is fully protected as national park and 1,153 km2 (445 sq mi) as wildlife sanctuary. It is part of the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion.The 14th Asiatic Lion Census 2015 was conducted in May 2015. In 2015, the population was 523 (27% up compared to previous census in 2010). The population was 411 in 2010 and 359 in 2005. The lion population in Junagadh District was 268 individuals, 44 in Gir Somnath District, 174 in Amreli District, and 37 in Bhavangar District. There are 109 males, 201 females and 213 cubs.<BR><br>The seven major perennial rivers of the Gir region are Hari, Shetrunji, Datardi, Shingoda, Machhundri, Godavari and Raval. The four reservoirs of the area are at four dams, one each on Hiran, Machhundri, Raval and Shingoda rivers, including the biggest reservoir in the area, the Kamleshwar Dam, dubbed 'the lifeline of Gir'. It is located at 21°08′08″N to 70°47′48″E.<BR><br>The count of 2,375 distinct fauna species of Gir includes about 38 species of mammals, around 300 species of birds, 37 species of reptiles and more than 2,000 species of insects.The carnivores group mainly comprises the Asiatic lion, Indian leopard, jungle cat, striped hyena, golden jackal, Bengal fox, Indian gray mongoose and ruddy mongoose, and honey badger. Asiatic wildcat and rusty-spotted cat occur, but are rarely seen.The main herbivores of Gir are chital, nilgai, sambar, four-horned antelope, chinkara and wild boar. Blackbucks from the surrounding area are sometimes seen in the sanctuary. Among the smaller mammals, porcupine and hare are common, but the pangolin is rare.<BR><br>The reptiles are represented by the mugger crocodile, Indian cobra, tortoise and monitor lizard which inhabit the sanctuary's bodies of water. Snakes are found in the bush and forest. Pythons are sighted at times along the stream banks. Gir has been used by the Gujarat State Forest Department which formed the Indian Crocodile Conservation Project in 1977 and released close to 1000 marsh crocodiles into Lake Kamaleshwar and other small bodies of water in and around Gir.The plentiful avifauna population has more than 300 species of birds, most of which are resident. The scavenger group of birds has 6 recorded species of vultures.

                <p>  Gujarat boasts some of the finest roads in India, along with one of the most intensive road covers of any Indian state. Moreover, Junagadh, the city close to the Gir reserve, is exceptionally well connected to major cities in Gujarat such as Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot and Bhavnagar. You can even find buses operating to the villages and small towns surrounding the forests. However, if you have a vehicle at your disposal, opt to take a ‘road trip’ as it can make getting around the forest reserve easy as well.</p>

</center>
            <div class="content">
                <p>While the National Park does not have a railway station or stopping of its own, the nearest station is in the municipality of Veraval. Veraval is a port city and is part of the Junagadh district. The distance from Veraval to the National Park is approximately 45 kilometres, and can be covered by hiring a taxi or cab. Cities close to Gir like Junagadh, Rajkot, and Bhavnagar are all well connected to other cities in Gujarat as well as metropolises like Delhi and Mumbai</p>

                <p>Again, Gujarat’s excellent infrastructure ensures that each of the towns of Junagadh, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, and Diu have functioning airports connecting them to the rest of the country. At a distance of approximately 95 kilometres, Diu is the closest airport to Gir, with multiple airlines flying to the city every day.</p>
